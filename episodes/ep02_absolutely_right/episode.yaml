      9:16 vertical video. Professional woman in stylish winter coat walks down snowy small-town street holding coffee, slightly distracted. She collides with handsome local man in puffer jacket and scarf, spills coffee on both of them. She's immediately flustered and apologetic. Warm golden bokeh lights, gentle snow falling. Handheld camera. 24fps, Hallmark rom-com aesthetic.

      9:16 vertical. Close-up of professional woman's face trying not to laugh, then pull back to show both standing awkwardly on snowy street.

Snow falls heavily between them creating romantic visual while interaction is uncomfortably robotic. 24fps, Hallmark cinematography with absurdist undertone.
